        <h2>Web Requests</h2>
        <p>We've discussed basic web requests and different methods that we can include in a web requests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web and
                mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP protocol.
                HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources. The term hypertext
                stands for text containing links to other resources and text that the readers can easily interpret.
                HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a
                resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for
                HTTP communication is port 80, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server
                configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We
                enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to reach the desired
                website.
