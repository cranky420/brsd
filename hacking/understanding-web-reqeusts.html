    <p>Here I've explored the intricacies of both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, understanding their flows and
        security implications.</p>

    <section id="web-requests-section">
        <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web and
                mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through the HTTP protocol.
                HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources. The term hypertext
                stands for text containing links to other resources and text that the readers can easily interpret.
                HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a
                resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for
                HTTP communication is port 80, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server
                configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We
                enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to reach the desired
                website.
                <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/url-structure.PNG" alt="breaking down an URL structure."
                    style="width:auto;height:128px;" />
            <li>
                HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of web communication. When a user accesses a
                website, their browser initiates an HTTP request to the server hosting the site.
                <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/HTTP-Flow.PNG" alt="HTTP flow" style="width: auto;height: 200px;">
            </li>
            <li>
                The request typically begins with the browser resolving the domain name to an IP address using DNS
                (Domain Name System). Once resolved, the browser sends a GET request to the server's default HTTP port
                (port 80), asking for the root path (/).
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and returns the requested resource, often an index
                file. However, all data exchanged during this process is transmitted in clear-text, making it vulnerable
                to interception and eavesdropping.
            </li>
            <li>Our browsers usually first look up records in the local '/etc/hosts' file, and if the requested domain
                does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the '/etc/hosts' to
                manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HTTPS Requests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, addresses the security shortcomings of HTTP by encrypting
                data transmission between the client and server.
                <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/HTTPS-Flow.PNG" alt="HTTPS flow structure"
                    style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
            </li>
            <li>
                When a user attempts to access a website via HTTPS, their browser establishes a secure connection with
                the server by following a series of steps known as the SSL/TLS handshake. This process includes key
                exchange and certificate verification to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the secure connection is established, HTTP communication continues, but all data exchanged is
                encrypted, providing confidentiality and protection against eavesdropping.
            </li>
            <li>
                If we type http:// instead of https:// to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to
                resolve the domain and redirects the user to the webserver hosting the target website. A request is sent
                to port 80 first, which is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the
                client to secure HTTPS port 443 instead. This is done via the 301 Moved Permanently response code.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>cURL</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                cURL (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP, HTTPS along with many
                other protocols.

                    style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
            </li>
            <li>Same functionality as cURL could alos be achieved by any web browser. Most modern web browsers come with
                built-in developer tools (DevTools).
                <img src="/brsd/hacking/images/Web-DevTool.PNG" alt="Dev Tool Image"
                    style="width: auto; height: 500px;">
            </li>
        </ul>
